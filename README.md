## FeedbackNotification
React widget used to add notifications to your application. Based on https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify.

## Features
- Show notifications
- Different default styling options
- Show loading bar based on the time that notification is shown
- Base time that notification is shown on an attribute
- Pause timer when hovered or site is not focussed
- Close notification by clicking it or dragging it

## Configuration
You can put this widget anywhere on your page, the place where the notifications are shown is controlled within the widget and can be changed with the position attribute. The widget cannot be placed in a list, since it should only be rendered once on the page.
The widget needs a data source and a context object that can be refreshed when there are new notifications(perhaps in combination with a timer). The widget shows all notifications that are returned in the datasource. 
**IMPORTANT**: Do not forget to set the notification as shown in the on show action to not show it again.
